# Changelog — Cape Wine Atlas production site

Newest first. Each entry is one sync to `production site/`.

## v0.10.0 — 2026-09-11 — September 2026 edition
`versions/cape-wine-atlas_2026-09-11_v0.10.0_september-2026-edition.html`

Launch items 2 and 3 closed — the page is now a site, built for GitHub Pages at capewineatlas.co.za.
- **Taken apart.** `src/` holds the template, script, stylesheet, map geometry and assets; `build_pages.py` builds `docs/` from them plus the atlas record. Typefaces and textures are files; each region's records are a separate file fetched only when that region is opened. A first visit is ~560 KB instead of 1.5 MB.
- **Addresses.** Every region has its own URL (`/region/<key>/`), pre-rendered for search engines and readable without script; opening a region updates the address, the back button closes it, and arriving on a region address opens it directly without the boot sequence. The licence page answers to `#licence`.
- **Page metadata:** titles, descriptions, canonical addresses, a share image (`og.jpg`), `sitemap.xml` with all 32 addresses, `robots.txt`, `CNAME`, `.nojekyll`, and a "Not on the record" 404 page in the house style.
- **One build, one gate.** `build_pages.py` carries the publication gate and also writes the archival single file, so `scripts/refresh_terroir_grid.py` is now a stub pointing at it.
- Built against the atlas's first `buildMode: public` build (gate: 644 records, 0 contact keys, 0 restricted, public).
- `SETUP-GITHUB-PAGES.md` — repository, Pages, DNS records for the domain, and the publish routine.

## v0.9.0 — 2026-09-11 — September 2026 edition
`versions/cape-wine-atlas_2026-09-11_v0.9.0_september-2026-edition.html`

First sync of the production tree. Carries the 10 September atlas build (644 producers · 31 regions · 1,133 verified honours · 144 records held back).

Launch item 1 closed:
- "Preview edition" retired everywhere on the page in favour of the dated edition stamp (derived from the build date).
- Held-back wording softened ("144 further records held back until they meet the publication standard"); every per-record and per-region honesty flag kept.
- Licence & Credits page added (footer link, `#licence`): licensor "the Cape Wine Atlas project, maintained by MDRF"; data ODbL 1.0 with the OpenStreetMap notice, Wikidata (CC0) and SAWIS; prose CC BY 4.0; code MIT; typefaces OFL; Neon Grid acknowledgement; ChatGPT-generated hero image statement; hand-drawn maps; corrections & removal draft; attribution line; full licence texts.
- Refresh script gains the publication gate (contact keys, licence-restricted provenance, `buildMode`).
- Patch for the atlas project's `scripts/collate.py` retiring the hard-coded "preview" label (applied 2026-09-11).

Earlier, before this tree existed (2026-09-03 → 2026-09-10):
- Boot screen, breathing dot-screen hero, hairline HUD geometry, live progress terminal, 3D Western Cape map with pulsing region markers, region pages for every region with in-browser tactical maps, gold closing page with hidden-halftone pixel reveal, continuously sweeping radar with fixed blips.
- All copy sourced from the atlas record; no file names or research-process vocabulary in visible text.
- Updated to the 10 September build: contact details no longer republished, corroborated awards marked, withheld records counted, OSM attribution, award ledgers contained within their cards, footer alignment, personal name removed from the visible licence line.
